# The TechWiki project ðŸ¤“

This is a little wiki of the technologies that I have used recently and the roadmap for my coding journey. Most of the technologies I knew before doing this website but I revisited recently.

### What I have used to build this?
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) with TypeScript
- Design: Figma, my design is [here](https://www.figma.com/design/STyTKRGChgRmLyvePV2eZV/Tech-Wiki?node-id=2-56&t=NVh36vfPvcedsqHm-1) (not the exact design, more of a guide than anything else ðŸ˜…)
- Styling: [TailwindCSS v.4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Routing: [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- RoadMap: [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)
